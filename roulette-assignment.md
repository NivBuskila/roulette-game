# Roulette Game - Junior Developer Assignment

## Overview

Welcome to your technical assignment! We'd like you to build a **full-stack roulette game** using modern web technologies. This project will demonstrate your ability to:

- Structure a TypeScript project across frontend and backend
- Work with game rendering libraries (Phaser 3)
- Design RESTful APIs
- Use AI tools effectively for accelerated development

**Time Allocated:** 5-7 days

---

## Context: Why This Assignment?

We know you're proficient with AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code. This assignment is designed to be challenging enough that AI tools are **expected and encouraged**. We want to see:

1. **How you architect** a non-trivial project
2. **How you integrate** separate services (frontend/backend)
3. **How you leverage AI** to write quality code quickly
4. **How you document** your work for team collaboration

### What We Care About

**Primary Focus:**
- Game logic correctness (bet types, payouts, RNG)
- API design and backend architecture
- TypeScript usage and code quality
- Frontend/backend integration

**Not Required:**
- User authentication or login system
- User management or multiple accounts
- Polished UI/UX (functional is fine)
- Advanced animations or visual effects

---

## Project Requirements

### 🎯 Core Functionality

Build a European roulette game (single-zero: 0-36) with:

1. **Backend Service** (TypeScript required)
   - RESTful API for game operations
   - Balance management system
   - All standard roulette bet types (see Technical Spec document)
   - Provably fair random number generation
   - Game history tracking

2. **Frontend Application** (TypeScript + Phaser 3 **required**)
   - Roulette wheel visualization with spin animation
   - Betting table with chip placement interface
   - All bet types supported through UI
   - Win/loss animations
   - Real-time balance display
   - Responsive design (desktop priority, mobile consideration)

3. **Service Integration**
   - Frontend must call backend for all game logic
   - No game outcomes calculated client-side
   - Proper error handling and loading states

---

## Technical Requirements

### Mandatory Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| **Frontend** | Phaser 3 + TypeScript | Required for game rendering |
| **Backend** | TypeScript (Node.js) | Framework choice is yours (Express, Fastify, NestJS, etc.) |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Both services must use TypeScript |

### What You Choose

You have **full creative freedom** on:

- **Visual theme/styling** (modern casino, retro arcade, minimalist, fantasy - your choice!)
- **Backend framework** (Express, Fastify, NestJS, or any TypeScript-compatible framework)
- **Data storage** (In-memory, SQLite, file-based - persistence not required)
- **Animation style** (realistic physics, arcade-style, abstract - make it yours!)
- **Additional libraries** (UI frameworks for betting interface, state management, etc.)

---

## Deliverables

- **Source code** in GitHub repository (public or invite us as collaborators)
- **README** with setup instructions and design decisions
- **Working demo** (deployed, video, or localhost instructions)

---

## Local Setup Guide

Your README should include clear instructions for running the project locally. At minimum:

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev  # or your start command
# Should run on http://localhost:3001 (or specify port)
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # or your start command
# Should run on http://localhost:3000 (or specify port)
```

**Environment Variables:**
Document any required environment variables (e.g., PORT, DATABASE_URL) with example values.

---

## What We'll Look At

1. **Run your project locally** - Does it work? Can we set it up in under 5 minutes?
2. **Place various bet types** - Do all bet types work correctly?
3. **Verify payouts** - Are calculations accurate for all scenarios?
4. **Test edge cases** - What happens with invalid bets, insufficient balance, etc.?
5. **Review code structure** - Is the code well-organized and maintainable?
6. **Check TypeScript usage** - Are types properly defined? Minimal use of `any`?
7. **Read your documentation** - Can we understand your design decisions?
8. **Assess game logic** - Is the backend logic sound and well-tested?

---

**Good luck! We're excited to see what you build.**

*Remember: This assignment is designed to be completed with AI assistance. We expect high-quality output because you have powerful tools at your disposal. Show us how you leverage modern development workflows.*
